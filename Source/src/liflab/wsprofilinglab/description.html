<h2>Structural Profiling of Web Sites in the Wild</h2>

<p>This is an instance of the <a href="https://github.com/liflab/labpal">LabPal</a>
experimental environment that processes data files about the structure
of web sites.</p>

<p>The lab contains results of a large-scale survey of more than
708 websites, in order to measure various features related to their size and
structure: DOM tree size, maximum degree, depth, diversity of element
types and CSS classes, among others. The goal of this research is to serve
as a reference point for studies that include an empirical evaluation on
samples of web pages.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>Over the past years, several tools and techniques have been developed to analyze,
debug, detect errors, or otherwise process the output produced by web applications.
Many of these tools focus on an analysis of the Document Object Model
(DOM) of a page, and accessorily to the Cascading Stylesheet (CSS) declarations
associated to its elements. A common point to these approaches
is that their scalability is dependent on features of a page
that are typically related to its size.
Most of the works duly provide an empirical evaluation of the
proposed tools on a sample of pages or websites. However, it is hard to assess
where these samples lie across the whole spectrum of web pages that may exist “in
the wild”.</p>

<p>The present work aims to address this issue. It reports on results of a large-
scale analysis of 708 websites, with the goal of measuring various parameters
related to the structure and size of their pages, such as the size of the DOM
tree, degree distribution of its nodes, depth, distribution of various element types,
diversity of CSS classes, etc. The goal of this research is to provide an objective
(albeit partial) reference point allowing practitioners to quantitatively situate
the samples used in research works that include an empirical evaluation.</p>
